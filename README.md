I am a passionate and motivated second year student, majoring in Software Development from
University of Technology Sydney (UTS). Working within various small teams on several projects at UTS
helps me develop a strong skill set that allows me to excel within fast-paced, dynamic and collaborative
working environment. I am proactively seeking a job within an organisation that values creating an
outstanding people culture to develop hand-on skills, progress future career and contribute my ability
to the development of the organisation.
